# Gradual Next Migration

This project shows the gist of how you can quickly slap in a client-side rendered React app into an [catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-routes) and go from there!

## Site

Deployed [here](http://gradual-next-migration.vercel.app/) so that you can easily see that react-router and client-rendering can work fine in a Next.js project. After the initial migration, you can begin to migrate on a page-by-page basis.
